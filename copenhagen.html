					<p><b>Preparing for Copenhagen in July</b></p>
					<p>July is one of the best months to visit Denmark’s capital, with long daylight hours and mild, comfortable temperatures. Here’s how to prepare and make the most of your visit:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Pack Light Layers:</b> While July is the warmest month in Copenhagen, temperatures can vary from 15-30°C. Pack a mix of short-sleeve shirts, light sweaters, and a jacket for cooler evenings.</li>
						<li><b>Bring Rain Gear:</b> July sees occasional rain showers, so an umbrella or a lightweight, waterproof jacket is essential.</li>
						<li><b>Comfortable Footwear:</b> Copenhagen is best experienced either walking or biking so make sure to take comfortable shoes. Have footwear that can keep you dry in case of showers.</li>
						<li><b>Sunscreen and Sunglasses:</b> The summer sun can be quite strong, so protect yourself with sunscreen and sunglasses if you are going to spend time outside.</li>
						<li><b>Stay Hydrated:</b> Whether you're cycling or walking around the city, carrying a reusable water bottle will help you stay hydrated throughout the day. Denmark's tap water is of higher quality than bottled water, as it must meet stringent standards set by the government.</li>
						<li><b>Safety:</b> Copenhagen is generally considered a very safe city, both for residents and visitors. Keep an eye on your belongings in crowded spaces. The metro system runs all night. In case of an emergency call 112.</li>
						<li><b>Traffic Safety:</b> Copenhagen is famous for its bike-friendly infrastructure. Cycling is a popular and safe way to get around, thanks to dedicated bike lanes and respect from motorists. In case you are coming with a car, keep an eye on cyclists.</li>
						<li><b>Sleeping:</b> Copenhagen daylight hours in July last from 5 AM to 9:30 PM. If you are sensitive to light while sleeping, consider bringing a sleeping face mask.</li>
						<li><b>Money:</b> Denmark uses Danish Kroner as a currency that is exchanged at €1=7.46DKK or $1=6.93DKK. The vast majority of shops accept credit/debit cards as a payment and a lot of small shops (especially food stalls) don’t accept cash. No need to bring physical cash with you.</li>
