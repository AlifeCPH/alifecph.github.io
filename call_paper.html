								<p>ALIFE 2024 will showcase a wide range of topics in Artificial Life, bringing together world-leading
								researchers to discuss the latest advances in the synthesis and simulation of living systems. Topics of
								interest include, but are not limited to, the following aspects of Artificial Life:</p>

								<ul>
									<li>Complex dynamical systems and networks</li>
									<li>Artificial chemistry, origins of life, computational biology</li>
									<li>Synthetic biology, protocells, and wet artificial life</li>
									<li>Ecology and evolution</li>
									<li>Bio-inspired, cognitive and evolutionary robotics, swarms</li>
									<li>Artificial intelligence and machine learning</li>
									<li>Perception, cognition, behavior</li>
									<li>Social systems, artificial and alternative societies</li>
									<li>Evolution of language, computational linguistics</li>
									<li>Artificial Life-based art</li>
									<li>Artificial Life in education</li>
								</ul>
								
								<p>The theme of ALIFE 2024 is “Exploring new frontiers”. Building on the ancient traditions of the Vikings
								to travel to new and strange lands and discover new cultures and traditions, we want to dedicate ALIFE 2024
								to the weird and wacky of ALIFE. In particular in a time where academic research is under pressure to be more
								applied, we will instead dedicate ALIFE 2024 to celebrate the fundamental science of artificial life.</p>

							<h2>Submission format</h2>
						</header>
						<div id="content">
							<article class="box post">
								<p>There are two options for submission: <b>full paper</b> or <b>extended abstract</b>. The format is exactly the same for both
								options. The difference resides in the number of pages and type of contents:</p>

								<ul>
									<li><b>full papers</b> have an 8-page maximum length (not including references) and should report on new, unpublished work;</li>
									<li><b>extended abstracts</b> are limited to a 2-page length (not including references) and can report on previously published work or preliminary results.</li>
								</ul>
								
								<p>Please see the author guidelines below for detailed instructions and manuscript templates.</p>
								
								<p>All submissions will undergo a detailed peer review process. Full papers will be reviewed for 
								timeliness, novelty, scientific quality, sound methodology, and use of appropriate analysis techniques.
								Extended abstracts will be reviewed for timeliness, novelty, and quality.</p>
								
								<p>Accepted submissions will be considered for oral or poster presentation, without distinction between full
								papers and extended abstracts.</p>
								
								<p>Accepted submissions (both full papers and extended abstracts) will be <b>published by MIT Press</b> as open-access electronic proceedings.</p>

							<h2>Author guidelines</h2>
						</header>
						<div id="content">
							<article class="box post">
								<p>Each submission will be reviewed in a double-blind review process. Hence, submissions should
								not contain any element that could reveal the identity of the authors (author names, affiliations
								and acknowledgments). Furthermore, any reference to any of the author’s own work should be made as
								if the work belonged to someone else.</p>
								
								<p>We encourage the use of LaTeX for the production of papers. LaTeX and Microsoft Word templates are available here:</p>
							
								<ul>
									<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lbovSWkZ6NAuj3mhsHRB9SZIBjXuKXvG/edit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ALIFE 2024 word template</a></li>
									<li><a href="https://www.overleaf.com/read/tmnmgsmmrkpy#ae2aac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ALIFE 2024 tex template</a></li>
								</ul>
							
								<p>Note that for both submission types you will need a text-only abstract, which will be displayed in the
								programme and on the web after publication. Note that in addition to the pdf you will need this text abstract
								when you upload your submission (<b>250 words max</b>, shorter preferred).</p>
								
								<p>The following formatting instructions apply to the final version of your manuscript, if it is accepted for publication:</p>
								
								<ul>
									<li>One single PDF, no additional file.</li>
									<li>PDF length: 8-page maximum length for full papers, 2-page maximum length for extended abstracts (<b>not including references</b> in the maximum length).</li>
									<li>PDF size: 5 MB maximum.</li>
									<li>All pages sized consistently at 8.5 x 11 (US letter format).</li>
									<li>No visible crop marks.</li>
									<li>Color figures are possible. Images at *no greater* than 300 dpi, scaled at 100%.</li>
									<li>Embedded open type fonts only.</li>
									<li>All layers flattened.</li>
									<li>All desired links active in the files: This can be done easily with LaTeX. To automatically turn all your internal references
									(citations, figures, equations, sections…) into internal hyperlinks in the PDF, add \usepackage{hyperref} in the preamble of your .tex file.
									If you get an error (“Paragraph ended before \Hy@setref@link was complete”) upon compilation, remove the .aux files and try to compile again,
									this should fix the problem. To insert links pointing outside the document, use \url{http://theurlyouwanttoinsert}. It will show the URL using a
									mono-spaced font and, if readers click on it in the PDF, their browser will be opened pointing at it.</li>

							<h2>Submission process</h2>
						</header>
						<div id="content">
							<article class="box post">
								<p>Submissions should be prepared following the author guidelines and uploaded to
								the <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=alife2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Easy Chair system</a>.
								You will need to create an Easy Chair account if you do not have one yet.</p>

								<p>Please enter appropriate keywords for your submission when prompted to help us organize the conference
								programme. You must also specify whether your submission is a full paper or an extended abstract.</p>

								<p>ALIFE 2024 will also include a number of special sessions. If you are submitting to one, you will be
								given the opportunity to select it during the submission process on Easychair. The submission and review
								process for special sessions will follow the same guidelines as the main conference.</p>

								<p>In addition, at ALIFE 2024 we will host several workshops. Workshop submissions, when available, will
								be managed separately from the main conference, with different deadlines and review processes. To submit
								a paper to a workshop, please follow the link to the respective website, which will be listed on the workshops
								page upon finalization of the workshops list.</p>

								<p><b>Important note</b>: at least one author of every accepted full paper or extended abstract must be registered,
								or the submission will be withdrawn. ALIFE 2024 will be a hybrid conference and will provide the necessary
								infrastructure for video presentations, and virtual participation.</p>

								<p>The Call for Papers opens on the <b>12th of February, 2024</b>.</p>
								
								<p>The deadline to submit your paper is on the <b>15th of April, 2024 (extended)</b> <s>10th of April, 2024 (extended) 3rd of April, 2024</s>. This deadline is "Anywhere on Earth" (AoE).</p>

								<p>If you have any questions, please contact us at <em>artificiallife2024@gmail.com</em><!-- <br />
								Make sure your e-mail subject is <em>Call for Papers</em>-->.</p>
