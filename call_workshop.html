								<p>The ALIFE 2024 workshops are intended to be forums to <b>present</b> and <b>discuss</b> new approaches,
								visions, or critical reflections within a research area. They provide an excellent opportunity
								to meet people with similar interests, to be exposed to cutting-edge research, and to exchange
								ideas in an informal setting. The <b>organizers</b> of an accepted workshop are <b>responsible for its
								coordination</b> and publicity (e.g., for sending out calls for papers/abstracts), for collecting
								and reviewing the papers/abstracts, and for maintaining a website providing a list of accepted talks.
								Workshops are <b>open to all</b> interested conference <b>participants</b> unless specifically justified otherwise
								in the application. Workshops can allocate either <b>one or two 1.5-hour time slots</b>.</p>

								<p>If accepted, ALIFE will provide the onsite and online logistics (seminar rooms, projectors, coffee
								breaks, zoom) and links from the main conference website. All other organizational issues — including
								separate review process and proceedings publication, if any — are taken care of by the workshop chairs.
								Therefore, any workshop-specific <b>requests</b> from participants should be exclusively <b>addressed to them</b>, not
								to the ALIFE committee. The internal organization of the satellite workshops and tutorials (website, paper
								submission, invited talks, proceedings, all deadlines except registration) is entirely left up to their
								respective organizers. Participation in workshops requires conference <b>registration</b>.</p>

								<p>ALIFE 2024 tutorials will be presented by <b>domain experts</b> to cover current topics relevant to artificial
								life researchers and practitioners, such as introduction to state-of-the-art methods and software. Each
								tutorial slot will be <b>1.5 hours</b> long. We encourage tutorial organizers to maintain a website that collects
								tutorials, demos, and interactive material.</p>

								<p>As for Tutorials, ALIFE will provide the onsite and online logistics (seminar rooms, projectors, coffee
								breaks, zoom) and links from the main conference website. All other <b>organizational issues</b> are taken care of
								by the <b>tutorial chairs</b>. Therefore, any tutorial-specific <b>requests</b> from participants should be exclusively
