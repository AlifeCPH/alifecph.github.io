							<p><b>Auditorium - Thursday, July 25th, at 18:30</b></p>
						
							<p><b>What is it? Research Cosplay:</b> Cosplay and/or perform as something from ALife research!
							For example, you can dress up like a boid, a small grid of neural cellular automata,
							or gather a small group of friends to form a glider and ‚Äúglide‚Äù across the room.
							What about dressing up like a kilobot? The possibilities are endless!</p>

							<p>The only requirement is that your costume and/or performance needs to be related to some
							aspect of ALife research (and of course, make sure that it is not offensive to members of
							our community‚Ä¶ but you already knew that).</p>

							<p>Relevant costumes made for previous cosplay events are welcome too! Additionally, costumes can be handmade or not, and performances can be original or not (do cite any sources!)</p>

							<p>There will be silly prizesüèÜ<br />
							There will also be time and space to work on your costume before showtime.</p> 

							<p><b>Academic karaoke:</b><br />
							Time to give a talk. But what on? Someone else‚Äôs slides of course, with absolutely no context whatsoever. You got this!</p>

							<p><b>Who can join?</b><br />
							Anyone at ALIFE 2024! Whether you‚Äôre an ERA member, a senior professor, or an industry engineer, you‚Äôre welcome to participate in ALife Cosplay & Karaoke!</p>
